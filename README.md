### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd football-analysis-platform
```

### 2. Environment Setup
Create `.env` files in each service directory:

**Frontend (`.env.local`):**
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

**AI Service (`.env`):**
```env
REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@db:5432/football_db
SPACES_KEY=your_spaces_key
SPACES_SECRET=your_spaces_secret
```

### 3. Run with Docker Compose
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 4. Access the Application
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **API Gateway**: http://localhost:8080
- **AI Service**: http://localhost:8000

## üì± Usage

### 1. Upload Video
- Navigate to the upload page
- Drag & drop or select a football video file
- Wait for cloud upload completion

### 2. Start Analysis
- Click "Analyze Video" to begin AI processing
- Monitor real-time progress updates
- Receive email notification when complete

### 3. View Results
- Access detailed match statistics
- Download enhanced video with analytics overlay
- Export analytics data as JSON

### 4. Team Comparison
- View possession percentages
- Analyze pass completion rates
- Compare individual player performance

## üéØ Key Innovations

### Jersey Color-Based Analysis
Unlike traditional systems that rely on predetermined team colors, our platform:
- Analyzes actual jersey colors from video footage
- Adapts to varying lighting conditions
- Handles third kit scenarios and goalkeeper differences
- Provides more accurate pass/interception detection

### Enhanced Trajectory Validation
- Validates ball movement patterns for genuine passes
- Distinguishes between intentional passes and random possession changes
- Dynamic tolerance based on pass distance
- Reduces false positives from tackles and deflections

### Real-time Visual Feedback
- Color-coded pass arrows matching actual jersey colors
- Progressive statistics overlay during video playbook
- Interactive team comparison charts
- Professional broadcast-quality visualizations

## üìä Sample Analytics Output

```json
{
  "match_stats": {
    "duration": "90:00",
    "possession": {
      "team_a": 65,
      "team_b": 35
    },
    "passes": {
      "team_a": {
        "completed": 245,
        "attempted": 289,
        "accuracy": 84.8
      },
      "team_b": {
        "completed": 156,
        "attempted": 198,
        "accuracy": 78.8
      }
    }
  }
}
```
